        <h1>An operator searching for a business to steward—patient, prepared, and all-in.</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Drew Nauman, founder of Telcontar LLC. I've led product strategy, analytics, and operations teams that launched 
          data-informed products, built KPI dashboards, and guided cross-functional go-lives. Now I’m channeling that toolkit into 
          acquiring and operating a small business in the Pacific Northwest—staying close to the floor, investing in people, and 
          building durable systems.
