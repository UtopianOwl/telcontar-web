        <h1>An operator searching for a business to steward—patient, prepared, and all-in.</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Drew Isaris, founder of Telcontar LLC. After leading product strategy and analytics teams across high-growth 
          technology companies, I’m channeling that discipline into acquiring and operating a small business in the Pacific Northwest. 
          I build quiet systems, invest in people, and stay close to the work.
